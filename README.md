# EE-568 Reinforcement Learning

My resources for Prof. Volkan Cevher's [Reinforcement Learning course](https://edu.epfl.ch/studyplan/en/master/robotics/coursebook/reinforcement-learning-EE-568) at EPFL, Spring 2026 edition.

- `slides/` contains the pdf slide decks for the lectures
- `notebookX_2026/` contains all files for assignment X - each one is an isolated `uv`-based python project/sub-repo (time to modernise and move on from vanilla pip and venv pal!)
